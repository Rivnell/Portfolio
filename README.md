# 💻 WaveTest

Automated software testing powered by clean code, chaotic ARAM energy, and yarn-based stress management.  
Because bugs fear structured coverage and a well-placed trap.

## 👋 About Me

With **three years of experience in software testing** at one of the world’s largest biotech companies, I’ve developed a sharp eye for detail and a love for solving complex problems.

I approach challenges with **curiosity** and a **positive mindset**, always eager to learn something new.

> 🎮 Proficient in playing **video games** (mostly League of Legends - ARAM)  
> 🧶 And **crocheting** — actual blankets

## 🐛 Test Philosophy

> “I test like I support in ARAM: watching the map, predicting mistakes, and saving the team from disaster.”  

> “Testing is like crocheting: one loop at a time, with patience, precision, and occasional swearing.”  

> “Writing tests is like dodging hooks in ARAM — it’s all fun and games until you get pulled into production.”

## 🎮+🧶 Fun QA Truths

> “My test coverage is tighter than a 5v5 under the turret at 8 minutes.”  
> “My test cases have more vision than a full build of Control Wards.”  
> “A good test is like a solid stitch — repeatable, reliable, and satisfying to look at.”  
> “In testing and crocheting, the first step is the same: read the damn pattern.”

### 🧠 Pro Tip:
> **When in doubt, test like it’s under turret, and crochet like it’s winter.**
