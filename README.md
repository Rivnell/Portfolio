## 👋 About Me

With **three years of experience in software testing** at one of the world’s largest biotech companies, I’ve developed a sharp eye for detail and a love for solving complex problems.

I approach challenges with **curiosity** and a **positive mindset**, always eager to learn something new.

> 🎮 Proficient in playing **video games** (mostly League of Legends - ARAM)  
> 🧶 And **crocheting** — actual blankets

## 🐛 Test Philosophy

> “I test like I support in ARAM: watching the map, predicting mistakes, and saving the team from disaster.”  

> “Testing is like crocheting: one loop at a time, with patience, precision, and occasional swearing.”  

> “Writing tests is like dodging hooks in ARAM — it’s all fun and games until you get pulled into production.”
