 With three years of experience in software testing at one of the world’s largest
 biotech companies, I’ve developed a sharp eye for detail and a love for solving
 complex problems. I approach challenges with curiosity and a positive mindset,
 always eager to learn something new. Proficient in playing video games and
 crocheting.
